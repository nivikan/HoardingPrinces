M:normal:Hello, my name is Princess Matcha. Are you one of the Princes who recently went missing?
D:normal:...Prince Darjeeling. A Pleasure.
M:excited:It's lovely to meet you! You don't need to be scared anymore, I'm here to-
D:angry:I don't know what you've heard but I do NOT need help. 
D:normal:I can get out whenever I want to. I just...need my sword.
M:normal:Sword, huh? I notice you're not wearing one...
D:angry:So what if I lost it!
D:angry:I'll get it back soon so you can leave. 
M:angry:I'm assuming you lost your sword fighting that dragon, correct.
D:normal:...
M:sad:Right, right, I'll get going.

M:normal:Hello Prince Darjeeling.
D:normal:Princess Matcha...welcome back I suppose. Do you have any business here?
M:happy:I'm assuming that dragon took your sword, right Darjeeling? 
D:angry:You don't need to worry about that. 
M:happy: I checked out the Dragon's Liar. It's definitely there.
D:sad:What? Did you now...
D:sad:...
D:normal:Thank you, Princess. Now that I know where my sword is, I will be able to find it and escape.
M:normal:My, Prince Darjeeling. I suppose even you can be polite if you put your mind to it. 
D:disappointed:Why you irritating...
M:normal:But, Prince, How do you plan on finding your sword if you can hardly leave this tower?
D:angry:...I...
M:happy:I am offering my help, Prince. ill you take it?
D:angry:...I...
D:sad:I do. Thank you for your help Princess Matcha. 
M:normal:No problem. Now, I can simply get you another sword. I better one and we could-
D:angry:No! It MUST be my sword. 
D:sad:I-it's a family heirloom. 
M:sad:I understand that the sword is important to you, Prince Darjeeling, but we can't put both our lives in danger for it. 
D:disappointed:Actually, the sword is all I have left of my sister. It's...much too precious to leave with a dragon.
D:sad:but I understand if you won't help me, Princess. It's dangerous to go into a Dragon's Lair. 
M:sad:...
M:disappointed:Your sister, huh? I see...Well! I will get help!
D:normal:excuse me.
M:excited:If I explain the situation to your parents...
M:excited:I can certainly convince them to give me a few extra soldiers to infiltrate the Dragon's Lair. 
D:sad:W-wait, Matcha...
M:normal:You're the prince from the kingdom close to the desert correct? Be back soon!
D:angry:Wait! Drat, she's gone.
/ 
M:normal:Prince Darjeeling!
D:normal:Princess Matcha.
D:sad:did you, er, meet my parents.
M:excited:I sure did, Prince Darjeeling....or should I say, Prince Darling.
D:blush:Ugh...Everyone in my kingdom has that annoying name for me...
D:normal:About my sword...
M:happy:Don't worry about that. With the help of your kingdom I was able to return it to the King and Queen. 
M:sad:They're still worried about you. They want you to safely return.
D:sad:I suppose I no longer need to hide my mistakes from them...I shouldn't have taken my sister's sword.
D:disappointed:But it was a shame to leave the sword in the royal vault...untouched and unseen...
M:normal:I'm sure your parents would understand. 
D:blush:I suppose...I should thank you.
M:normal:My my, Darling, no need to be so shy.
D:angry:Quit teasing me, I'm trying to be serious....
M:blush:I am too...Prince Darjeeling I didn't help you out of selflessness. I was actually quite enamored with you when we first met. 
D:blush:M-Matcha...
M:sad:But don't get me wrong, I'm not expecting anything for saving you. 
M:disappointed:I suppose it was just easier to express my feelings for you after I'd helped you out...It's a bit cruel of me...
D:normal:...
D:blush:I'm glad you did so Matcha...I wouldn't be adverse to starting some sort of relationship...
M:blush:P-Prince, Darjeeling. Are you sure...?
D:happy:Of course. You are after all, my knight in shining armor. 
M:happy: Will you be my darling, then?
D:angry:Don't push your luck.
