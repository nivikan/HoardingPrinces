M:normal: My, my, what do we have here? By your rich clothing I'd say you are one of the princes the dragon has kidnapped.
C:happy:A visitor! A woman, nay, a PRINCESS!
M:happy:What an enthusiastic greeting. I assume you don't get visitors much?
C:sad:Alas, I do not. Such a shame this lovely face should be hidden from all those who deserve to gaze upon my beauty.
M:happy:My, what a modest, prince.
C:excited:Oh GLORIOUS DAY! My fair Princess. My name is Chrysanthemum. 
M:normal:What a diginified name. But I think I will call you... Chrys. It suits you a little better, don't you agree?
C:sad:Everyone says that. 'Tis my curse. How tragic that such a charming name should be reduced to such drugdery…
C:normal:How did my princess possibly make it past the dragon? Was it not difficult?
M:normal:Not terribly difficult. And it was worth it for me to meet such a cut little Prince.

 M:sigh:This is our second meeting.
 C:confused:I missed you since your last visit
 M:normal:I've thought nothing but you since my departure.
 /
 C:angry:You've come here for a third time- why?
 M:normal:Baby, I know its fast and I know we barely know each other but I love you, Babe. We should get married
 C:normal: OMG! We totally should!
 /
 C:angry:Who are you?
 M:normal:You need to get out. There's a ferocious dragon here.
 C:normal:It's ok, I like the dragon. Please Leave

 C:normal: Hi, Princess.
 M:normal: Prince, I have to come with me today.
 C:normal: No
 M:normal: What?
 C:normal: The dragon... is pretty kind.
