P:normal:...Hello...
TL:happy:Hello there, young one.
TL:normal:Is there anything I can do for you?
P:normal:Are you the prince that went missing from the coastal kingdom?
TL:sad:I...ah...may be.
P:normal:My name is Princess Pepper. I'm here to rescue you, Prince Thistle.
TL:happy: Alliteration. I like it. But about the other matter...
P:normal:...?
TL:sad:How desperate would you say my kingdom is to have me back?
P:normal:...
TL:happy:Surely they can wait a bit before I return. After all, I have three other brothers.
P:normal:You...don't want to be rescued?
Tv:normal:Perhaps another time? Definitely when I get through this book...Probably...

TL:normal:Why, Pepper, how nice of you to visit me. I was just about to sit down for tea. Would you care to join me?
P:normal:You seem awfully well adjusted for someone kidnapped by a dragon.
TL:happy:Yes, well, isolation does have its perks doesn’t it? 
P:normal:No. Why don’t you enlighten me?
TL:sad:Well…I suppose I have always been an introvert.
TL:disappointed:But more importantly, being in these towers has given me so much time that I never had before.
TL:excited:I can finally read as many books as I want to. And research! I have time to follow whatever catches my interest.
P:angry:Your kingdom needs you.
TL:sad:Y-yes, I know. 
P:normal:Listen. Prince Thistle, I can understand where you’re coming from. I’m also…not very good with people…and responsibilities…
TL:normal:No need to convince me, Princess, I understand that I need to return to my kingdom at some point. I just need to ready my heart. 
P:normal:…
TL:sad:I know, I’m being very childish. But the dragon isn’t a cruel keeper. And I have my books….
P:normal:…
P:normal:You mentioned your brothers before…Don’t you miss them?
TL:sad:My brothers…yes, they must be worried about me. But I could ask you the same, Princess Pepper. Isn’t your family worried about you as you rescue mysterious men from dragon guarded towers?
P:sad:…
TL:disappointed:Excuse me. That was personal.
P:normal:No, I apologize for talking about your brothers first. 
P:normal:…Actually, I am on this quest to help my kingdom.
P:sad: You see, we are in a bit of a financial struggle. 
P:normal:I’ve been on the trail of this dragon to find its treasure and save my kingdom.
P:sad:when I found out the dragon had kidnapped princes from the neighboring kingdom, I figured I would save them and…
TL:normal:…and my kingdom would owe yours, most likely financially, for saving me.
P:normal:…Yes.
P:normal:Are you upset?
TL:sad:No. I understand. 
TL:normal:The responsibility of royals is first and foremost to their kingdom. You were simply looking out for yours.
P:sad:…I’ll head out for today. But please think about leaving this place. Not only for the sake of my kingdom but yours as well.
TL:normal:…

TL:normal:Ah, Pepper. How nice of you to join me.
P:normal:Hello, Thistle…you seem to be in a better mood today.
TL:normal:Yes…I was thinking about what you said before.
P:sad:I apologize for that, Prince.
TL:sad:No, it’s not that, Princess. I was-how should I put it?-impressed.
TL:normal:I was impressed with your determination to fulfill your responsibility to your kingdom. 
P:blush:Why…Thank you…
TL:happy:I suppose it would be wise of me to learn from you. 
P:normal:Prince Thistle, I don’t want to pressure you into going back to your kingdom in order to help my own. 
P:happy:Do what you want. 
P:normal:I…I don’t think that dragon is actually going to hurt you. It seems almost fond of you….
TL:happy:I’ve grown quite fond of it myself.
TL:sad:It does seem like a sad creature. It almost reminds me of myself…how I used to be at the palace.
P:normal:…
TL:happy:But the palace is also my home. It may seem like a cage at times but this…this tower is a cage too.
P:happy:I’m glad…
TL:blush:If you can support your kingdom and still be so noble…Pepper…Then surely I can as well.
P:blush:Are you ready?

TL:normal:Ah, Pepper. How nice of you to join me.
P:normal:Hello Thistle…ready to go home?
TL:sad:I-I…
TL:normal:I’m sorry. But I’ve decided to stay here.
Pepper:sad:…
Pepper:sad:For your books…?
TL:normal:That too… 
TL:blush:And some other reasons. I need to stay here. Someone needs me.
Pepper:sad:…
P:normal:Do what you want. 
P:sad: I…I don’t think that dragon is actually going to hurt you. It seems almost fond of you….
