THISTLExTHYME
T:normal:Well, hello there.
Th:normal:Hello? Hello!! There is a dragon outside! Come on! I’m here to rescue you!
T:normal:Rescue?Hm…
T:sad:What an inopportune time. 
Th:angry:Excuse me?
T:normal:Actually, I’m in the middle of the riveting text. I can hardly imagine leaving right now.
Th:angry:Gah! read your text some other time we need to get going NOW!
T:sad:Must we?
T:normal:Why don’t you come back later once I’m finished with my research. It should only take a few hours.
Th:angry:Y-You…
T:normal:…
Th:sad:maybe I will leave before I end up killing this idiot…

Th:normal:Prince Thistle! 
T:normal:hm?
Th:happy:That’s you’re name isn’t it? You’re brothers are looking for you. 
T:sad:Are they now? 
Th:excited:Well?Doesn’t that make you want to go back to your kingdom?
T:normal:….
T:sad:Can you stop yelling? 
T:normal:Honestly, I’m trying to read.
Th:angry:Why you…!
T:normal:You sound like my nursemaids and tutors at the palace. They were also quiet demanding.
Th:angry:Perhaps it’s because you’re so vexing?
T:happy:Well, think what you will. I’m much happier here than back home so you’ll have to try extra hard to get me to leave.
Th:angry:And what about the dragon?
T:normal:what about it?
Th:angry:it can eat you, y’know. What if it kills you?
T:normal:What if it does?
Th:normal:…
T:happy: we’ll wait and see.
Th:sad:Right…I get it, there’s definitely nothing I can say to get you to leave?
T:normal:…I’m quiet happy here thank you. 
T:happy:What’s your name?
Th:normal:Hm? it’s Thistle. Princess Thistle.
T:happy:Princess Thistle. If you ever go back to my kingdom…Tell my brothers that I’m sorry for being…the way I am.
Th:normal:…will do.
