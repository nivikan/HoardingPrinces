T:sad:Ha!
D:normal:…I suppose you were able to sneak past the dragon?
T:normal:Are you the Prince that’s kept here by that dragon?
D:normal: And who would you be?
T:angry:No time for that now, we need to leave before that dragon comes back. 
D:angry:Leave? 
D:normal:Please, I can leave whenever I want to. You’re services are not necessary.
T:normal:Services? 
T:angry:I’ve heard of a rude prince that lives around these parts. Don’t be so prideful.
D: Rude? I’m simply allowing this dragon to keep me until I can get my sword back.
T:normal:right….
T:normal:You lost your sword? Is it really this important?
D:sad: … 
T:angry:…Gah!
T:angry: I can hear that dragon coming. I’ll be back, perhaps you’ll be more receptive to my help then…

D:normal:Well if it isn’t...
T:normal:Thyme.
D:happy:A knight?
T:normal:Princess actually. Are you ready to go now?
D:angry:Are you checking up on me? Frankly, it’s not appreciated. 
T:angry:Is this about that sword? Just leave it behind. You can’t just stay here until that monster decides to eat you.
D:angry:Excuse you, but that sword is an important family heirloom and I...lost it. 
T:normal:Fine then…I’ll find it for you, where is it?
D:happy:Wha-Ah, I mean…
D:angry:If I knew I would have it wouldn’t I? I don’t know. It’s probably long gone by now. 
D:sad:That...That dragon took it when I came here to smite the beast.
T:normal:Smite it? By yourself? And I assume that bravado didn’t work for you?
D:sad:No need to rub salt to the wound, Princess.
T:normal:…hm.
D:normal:I’m not returning to my kingdom. Without that sword. I-It’s impossible.
T:normal:…
T:sad:…Well, I suppose that’s not COMPLETELY crazy.
D:happy:Ah!
D:You think so?
T:happy:Yes, my sword is pretty special too. 
T:normal:My brothers gave it to me when I began my journey. I would hate to lose it. 
T:normal:I assume your sword has some sort of similar back story?
D:normal:….
T:angry: Look!
T:sad: ah, that is. I’d LIKE to help you but I wan to know why I’m risking my life to get a sword.
T:disappointed:I mean… If you really think I’m bothering you I’ll leave, but…
D:normal:…it was my sister’s.
T:normal:what?
D:sad:The sword was my sister’s. She died in battle when I was much younger …it’s all my family has left of her. 
D:normal:I just couldn’t leave it hanging up in our castle as an heirloom forever…she wouldn’t have wanted that.
T:happy:castle, huh? You’re a prince?
D:happy:Prince Darjeeling actually.
T:happy:Ah! I’ve heard of you.
T:blush:you’re as pretty as the rumors say.”
D:blush:R-Rumors?
T:excited:haha, yeah and they say your nickname is Prince DARLING.
D:angry: It. Is. NOT.
T:happy: hehe.
T:normal:I’ll find that sword for you. The dragon took it right? I’ll check it’s Liar.
D:normal:…be careful.

D:happy:Thyme!
T:happy:You remembered my name. I’m honored, Prince Darling.
D:Blush:I see you remembered mine as well. 
T:happy:I’m here to take you out of this tower, Darjeeling, and I’m not taking “No” for an answer. 
D:angry:Wha-? Didn’t I tell you before? If I’m returning home, it must be with the sword or with nothing else. 
T:normal:Fine. I get it.
T:happy:I was just teasing. I came prepared.
D:excited:T-That’s my sword. How did you…? 
T:normal:Like I thought, it was in the Dragon’s Lair.
T:angry:I had a hard time sneaking in.
D:angry:Y-you…And you called me foolish before, how could you sneak in there by yourself? 
T:normal:Actually, it was much easier than I thought. 
T:angry:T-the dragon actually came back while I was inside.
D:angry:Gah! Are you alright?
T:normal:I’m fine, the dragon didn’t attack. Almost as if… it wanted me to come save you.
T:happy:That dragon must have developed quite a fondness for you. 
D:normal:Yes, well, the feeling is NOT appreciated.
T:blush:I-I’ve developed something of a fondness as well.
D:normal:…
D:blush:…that. That’s a sentiment I may be able to reciprocate. 
T:blush:..ha…
D:blush:hm…quite. I suppose, a thank you is in order.
T:happy:Don’t mention it. Ready to leave this tower, Prince Darjeeling?
D:happy:Most, definitely.
